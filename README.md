# RipeFruit
A computer vision program using OpenCV python library meant to allow farmers to track the ripeness of a variety of fruits. Uses a UI to allow a farmer to choose the fruit they want to track and then utilizes OpenCV color detection features to create a bitmask to determine ripeness based on a range of HSV values.
